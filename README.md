# Mushroom-Classification-using-Decision-Trees
### Overview
This project implements a Decision Tree classification model to determine whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous based on various features. The dataset includes attributes such as cap shape, color, odor, and habitat. By analyzing these characteristics, the model accurately predicts the edibility of mushrooms, providing a valuable tool for identifying safe mushroom consumption. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of Decision Trees in creating interpretable models for binary classification tasks.
